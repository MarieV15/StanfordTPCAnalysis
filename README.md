# TMSAnalysis

This is a python-based analysis package intended to process and 
analyze data taken on the various detectors in the Gratta Lab at 
Stanford. The input can be data files produced by either the NGMDaq
software package (used to read data from Struck 3316 digitizers)
or CAEN's Wavedump software. This code first converts the files into
a pandas-readable HDF5 format, then does the waveform processing to 
produce reduced variables for analysis. The end result are HDF5 files
containing pandas dataframes.
